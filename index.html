<h2>Visualizing Global Land–Ocean Temperature Change (1924–2024)</h2>

<div class="card">
<p>
Global mean surface temperature is one of the most widely used and trusted indicators
of climate change. From 1924 to 2024, our planet has undergone dramatic shifts in climate
conditions, reshaping ecosystems, weather patterns, and human livelihoods. Studying this
100-year window allows us to observe the transition from early industrial conditions to
the rapid warming driven by modern fossil fuel use, industrialization, and urban expansion.
</p>

<p>
Our objective is to transform abstract climate statistics into meaningful visual evidence.
Through data visualizations, we trace how natural fluctuations evolved into persistent
warming trends and examine how historical developments align with measurable temperature
changes across both land and ocean surfaces.

<!-- ================= GOAL ================= -->
<section id="goal">
<h2 class="section-heading">Goal of the Project</h2>

<div class="card">
<p>
The goal of this project is to visualize and analyze global land and ocean surface
temperature changes over the past century. By highlighting long-term warming patterns,
we aim to provide context for how modern climate change has developed and how it connects
to historical climate-influencing events.
</p>

<!-- ================= DATA ================= -->
<section id="data">
<h2 class="section-heading">Data Introduction</h2>

<div class="card">
<p>
For this project, we use the NASA GISTEMP v4 dataset published by the NASA Goddard
Institute for Space Studies (GISS). This dataset provides monthly and annual global
surface temperature anomalies from 1880 to the present. Our analysis focuses on the
most recent 100 years (1924–2024) in order to assess how Earth’s climate has shifted
throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.
</p>

<p>
Each NASA record includes the year, global temperature anomaly relative to the
1951–1980 baseline, and separate land and ocean averages. To improve reliability
and reduce dataset-specific bias, we also compare NASA results with NOAA’s Global
Temperature (NOAAGlobalTemp) dataset. While the two datasets use slightly different
methodologies, they produce consistent long-term warming trends.
</p>

<p>
Together, these datasets offer a robust and standardized view of long-term global
temperature change, strengthening confidence in the conclusions drawn from our
visualizations.

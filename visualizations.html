    <!-- PROJECT CONTEXT -->
    <section>
        <p>
        Global mean surface temperature is one of the most widely used and trusted indicators
        of climate change. From 1924 to 2024, Earth has undergone profound shifts in climate
        conditions, reshaping ecosystems, weather patterns, and human livelihoods.
        </p>

        <p>
        The visualizations below transform global temperature anomaly data into
        intuitive visual evidence, illustrating how short-term variability evolves into
        persistent, long-term global warming.

            <h2>Average Global Temperature Change per Decade (1924–2024)</h2>

            <p><strong>Question: How have global temperature anomalies changed from decade to decade?</strong></p>

            <p>
            This bar chart summarizes global average temperature anomalies by decade using
            NASA’s land–ocean surface temperature index. Early decades show near-zero or
            negative anomalies relative to the 1951–1980 baseline.
            </p>

            <p>
            Beginning in the 1970s, temperature anomalies rise steadily above zero, with
            each subsequent decade becoming warmer than the last. This visualization clearly
            demonstrates the long-term, cumulative nature of global warming.

            <h2>Annual Global Temperature Anomalies (1924–2024)</h2>

            <p><strong>Question: How have global temperature anomalies varied year by year?</strong></p>
            <p>
            This visualization presents annual global temperature anomalies from NASA’s dataset,
            highlighting how individual years exhibit noticeable variability due to natural climate
            processes such as volcanic activity and large-scale ocean circulation patterns.
            </p>

            <p>
            This interactive line visualization displays annual global temperature anomalies from
            1924 to 2024 using NASA’s land–ocean temperature index relative to the 1951–1980 climate
            baseline. Each data point is color-coded along a red–blue diverging scale, where blue
            represents cooler-than-average years and red represents warmer-than-average years,
            allowing quick visual distinction between periods of cooling and warming. Interactive
            features—including hover-enabled tooltips, a range slider, and a decade-selection
            dropdown menu—enable users to explore year-to-year variability and focus on specific
            periods of interest. A dashed horizontal line marks the zero-anomaly baseline, emphasizing
            the transition from predominantly cooler years in the early 20th century to persistent
            and accelerating warming beginning in the late 20th century. Overall, this visualization
            provides an intuitive way to examine both short-term fluctuations and the long-term global
            warming trend.

            <h2>NOAA Global Temperature Anomalies (1924–2024)</h2>

            <p><strong>Question: What long-term trend emerges when smoothing short-term temperature variability?</strong></p>

            <p>
            This interactive visualization shows NOAA global temperature anomaly data across
            a full century. Annual values capture short-term variability, while interactive
            elements allow closer inspection of specific years.
            </p>

            <p>
            The visualization highlights a clear acceleration in warming beginning in the
            latter half of the 20th century, supporting scientific consensus that modern
            global warming is persistent and systemic.

            <h2>Distribution of NOAA Temperature Anomalies by Decade</h2>

            <p><strong>Question: How has the distribution of temperature anomalies shifted over time?</strong></p>

            <p>
            This boxplot compares the distribution of NOAA temperature anomalies across
            different decades. Earlier decades are clustered around cooler or near-zero
            values with relatively limited spread.
            </p>

            <p>
            More recent decades show higher median anomalies and greater variability,
            indicating that modern warming reflects a shift in the entire temperature
            distribution rather than changes in isolated extreme years.

            <p><strong>Question: How do seasonal temperature patterns change across a century?</strong></p>

            <p>
            This heatmap visualizes monthly global temperature anomalies over time using
            Berkeley Earth data. Color intensity reflects anomaly magnitude, revealing
            both seasonal patterns and long-term warming.
            </p>

            <p>
            The visualization shows that warming is not confined to a particular season—
            temperature increases appear consistently across months, emphasizing the
            global and persistent nature of climate change.

        <h2 class="section-heading">Visualization-Based Conclusions</h2>

        <p>
        Taken together, these visualizations reveal a clear and consistent narrative:
        global temperatures have risen steadily over the past century, with acceleration
        in recent decades.By combining annual trends, decade-level summaries, distributional comparisons,
        and seasonal patterns, the evidence strongly supports the conclusion that modern
        global warming reflects a systemic shift in Earth’s climate rather than isolated
        natural fluctuations.
